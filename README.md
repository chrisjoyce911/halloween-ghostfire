## Score

Worked out version of tune from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvoSeYF0s9A

Transposed to https://flat.io using interface to create sheet music. The touch keyboard shows the note names to make it easier to translate to code.

Exported the score to ./score directory. The score is in two parts and not in the correct order due to time constraints and lack of UI knowledge.
